    1. Asks user to input the number of their friends joining
    the dinner.
    2. Asks user to enter their names.
    3. Initializes a dictionary using this information, initial values
    of the share per person are set to 0.
    4. Asks user to input the bill, calculates the share per peron and updates
    it in the dictionary.
    5. Additionally, it has a "Lucky one" function that randomly chooses a lucky one among the
    friends. This person won't pay their part, instead it will be shared among their friends.
    6. Prints the dictionary with friends' names and their respective bill shares.
    Returns: none.
